# Initial Prompt
Create a gamified evolution simulator. Make it so that the final output is a SINGLE RUNNABLE html file. We want to show each generation getting better, and add some ability to modify parameters. Make it visually interesting, add some styling elements.
# First Follow-up
make it more clear what is being evolved/selected for. Add ux and graphics. make the sim more complex
# Second Follow-up (o3 mini only)
add more complexity, features, params, and UX. Make this version something people would pay for.
