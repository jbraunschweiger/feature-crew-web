Prompt for a Coding AI: City Generator & Simulation
Project Overview:
Develop a city generator and simulation that procedurally creates a visually interesting and
representative urban environment. The generator should dynamically construct buildings,
roads, districts, parks, and other urban elements while simulating aspects such as population
growth, traffic flow, and economy. The goal is to provide a realistic yet stylized simulation that
allows users to observe and interact with an evolving cityscape.
Core Features:
1. Procedural City Generation
● Generate a grid-based or organic road network with main roads, intersections, and side
streets.
● Create distinct districts (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, downtown, suburban,
rural outskirts).
● Populate the city with building types based on district zoning:
○ Skyscrapers and office buildings in commercial areas.
○ Houses, apartments, and condos in residential zones.
○ Factories and warehouses in industrial sectors.
● Implement parks, rivers, and green spaces for a balanced urban design.
● Vary architectural styles and heights to make the city visually diverse.
2. Simulation Dynamics
● Simulate population growth and migration based on available housing, jobs, and
amenities.
● Implement traffic simulation with moving vehicles, pedestrians, and public transport.
● Introduce an economic system with fluctuating property values, business activity, and
tax revenue.
● Add time progression, allowing the city to expand, upgrade, or decay over time.
3. Visual & Aesthetic Elements
● Use low-poly, pixel art, or semi-realistic rendering to balance performance and
aesthetics.
● Implement day-night cycle and weather effects (rain, fog, snow) to enhance realism.
● Add lighting effects for streetlights, car headlights, and building windows.
● Provide a camera system allowing zooming, panning, and top-down or isometric views.
4. User Interaction & Customization
● Allow users to manually place roads, buildings, and modify zones (sandbox mode).
● Implement a procedural mode where cities are generated automatically.
● Provide sliders and toggles to control density, road layouts, and simulation speed.
● Include random city seed generation for endless variety.
5. Optimization & Performance Considerations
● Use data structures like quad-trees or spatial hashing for efficient rendering and
pathfinding.
● Implement multi-threading or asynchronous processing for smooth simulation.
● Optimize for scalability to handle small towns to large metropolitan areas.
Advanced Features:
● AI-Driven NPC Behavior: Citizens with daily routines, work shifts, and leisure activities.
● Historical Evolution: City grows from a small town to a futuristic metropolis.
● Disasters & Events: Fires, floods, traffic jams, or economic recessions affecting city
growth.
● Multiplayer Mode: Shared cities where multiple users contribute to urban planning.
Goal & Expected Output:
● A working prototype that generates a city dynamically and simulates activity.
● A visually engaging experience that represents a realistic or stylized city.
● A scalable and interactive environment where users can observe or influence growth.
Would you like to refine any aspects, such as focusing on realism vs. stylization,
performance constraints, or specific visual styles? :rocket:
